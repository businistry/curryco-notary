# frontend-structure

The project utilizes multiple landing page variations that serve different presentation purposes:

Landing Page Hierarchy:
- curry-co-landing.html: Primary landing page template
- index.html: Main entry point and default landing
- landing2.html: Alternative landing page variation

These templates form a coordinated set of entry points, though their specific differentiation points are not detailed in the specification. The pages appear to be connected through a shared contact form integration via api/contact.js.

Relationship Structure:
```
curry-co-landing.html ─┐
                       ├── api/contact.js
index.html ───────────┤
landing2.html ────────┘
```

Business Impact Score: 45
The multiple landing page approach indicates a deliberate business strategy for different entry points, though the specific business logic driving template selection is not specified.
