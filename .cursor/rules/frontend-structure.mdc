# frontend-structure

The frontend structure consists of three landing page variations:

1. curry-co-landing.html
- Primary landing page
- Business importance: 85
- Functions as main entry point for the Curry Co website

2. index.html
- Alternate landing page format
- Business importance: 75
- Serves as default route entry

3. landing2.html  
- Secondary landing variant
- Business importance: 70
- Alternative landing experience

The landing pages appear to work in conjunction with the contact API endpoint (api/contact.js), though specific interaction details are not defined in the specification.

File relationships:
```
curry-co-landing.html ─┐
index.html            ─┼─ api/contact.js
landing2.html         ─┘
```
