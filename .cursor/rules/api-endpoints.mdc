# api-endpoints

The specification outlines the existence of a contact-related API endpoint but provides limited implementation details. The core components include:

## Contact API Structure
- Endpoint location: `api/contact.js`
- Frontend integration points in:
  - curry-co-landing.html
  - index.html 
  - landing2.html

The API appears to handle contact form submissions and frontend-to-backend communication across multiple landing page variants.

Importance Score: 45
- Supporting business functionality for contact management
- Standard contact form integration pattern
- Multiple frontend entry points suggest a reusable contact component
