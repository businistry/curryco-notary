The contact form API endpoint integration consists of a basic form submission workflow between frontend HTML pages and a contact.js API handler.

Key Integration Points:
- Form submission handling from landing pages to contact API
- Basic request/response structure for contact form data
- Contact form processing in api/contact.js

Available Endpoints:
